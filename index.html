    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <img alt="Its Me" src="./Assets/me for portfolio.jpg" >

    <p> My name is Xzaviah and I was born in Las Vegas Nevada.
    I spent 12 years of my life here and ended up moving to
    cold Minnesota to complete high school. I went to Minnetonka
    High School, a school well known for their studies and it
    was definitely an expirience. After graduating High School 
    I moved to Phoenix Arizona to begin college. I didnt have
    a set degree I was looking for so I decided to complete my 
    first two years in a community college. I was really indecisive
    and changed my major about three or four times. Then, Covid-19 
    came and interferred with my plans. I had to switch to online 
    which was a little harder for me as I sometimes learn best at 
    in person classes, yet I pushed through. During this time I 
    changed my major probably twice more until I decided I was not 
    ready to fully commit to a major/career yet. I took a gap year
    to find out what careers really interested me and now here I 
    am studying at UNLV to become Software Engineer! :)
